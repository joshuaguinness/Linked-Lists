# Linked-Lists

A program that randomly creates a linked list which then has linked lists attached to each node of the original linked list. The program then flattens the entire strucutre into one, sorted, linked list.

In this project, I learned all about structures in C, improved my understanding of pointers, and grew in my knowledge of linked lists and the algirthms that surround it.

To run: type "make"

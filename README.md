# Linked-Lists

A program that randomly creates a linked list which then has linked lists attached to each node of the original linked list. The program then flattens the entire strucutre into one, sorted, linked list.

For example, the original, unsorted horizontal and vertical linked lists is seen below:

9 -> 37  
11 -> 35 57 57 59  
25 -> 32  
29 -> 46 62  
43 -> 49 60 69  

After function "flatten" is applied to the original linked list, the new linked list becomes:

9 11 25 29 32 35 37 43 46 49 57 59 60 62 68

The program can also handle much bigger sizes

In this project, I learned all about structures in C, improved my understanding of pointers, and grew in my knowledge of linked lists and the algorithms that surround it (e.g. inserting, reversing, merging).
